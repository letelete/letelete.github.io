Itâ€™s been an amazing 50 days spent participating in the Google Code-in contest, during which I've had the opportunity to enhance my skills in Android development and UI/UX design. Additionally, I've honed my automation skills by building Python tools, significantly improving code review performance and gaining valuable new experiences.

Overall, it's been a rewarding journey filled with fun and learning!

## Butâ€¦ What is Google Code-in?

To be brief, Itâ€™s an **international contest** focused on Software Development, Research, Design and principally, Open-Source!

## Organization

Google Code-in brings together a variety of organizations, all keen on connecting people, with power of Open-Source. Since the beginning, I wanted to dive into the Android field, so Iâ€™ve done some research before participating and found organizations that maintain projects in this technology.

Finally, I chose the [Mifos Initiative](https://mifos.org) which is a sub-organization of [Digital Impact Alliance](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/organization/5735553819475968).

## What GCI gave me?

So much new experience.

Iâ€™ve been involved in 2 Android projects: [MifosPay](https://github.com/openMF/mobile-wallet) & [Self-Service-App](https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile). I had to work in a much larger code-base than ever before.

The first few days were hard for me since I have been trying to make myself familiar with the project structure and overall contributions standards. After some time I felt much more confident, and started to contribute on my own, by finding unapparent ways to improve the [MifosPay](https://github.com/openMF/mobile-wallet) app.

## Climbing to the top

Instead of contributing to actual tasks, I tried to think outside the box of ways that could bring a significant improvement over the product. It bothered me, how obscure and unintuitive the app is, so Iâ€™ve suggested changing the actual layout, to improve user interest and the overall quality of the app.

Iâ€™ve created a completely new UI/UX proposal according to the newest Material Design 2.0 standards. Since the mentorsâ€™ review of my proposal, Iâ€™ve been responsible for the redesign implementation, where I and other contributors were successfully changing the app appearance and some of the Frontend functionalities (Check out the redesign branch!).

I found the process challenging, but rewarding at the same time. I learned a lot, and had an opportunity, to carry out some code reviews.

## Automatization

Mifos mentors did a great job of creating a variety of tasks. Iâ€™ve done 38 of them. Surprisingly, the easiest and most mundane ones, turned out to be the most interesting.

Why? They were open for creativity, and finding some non-trivial solutions.

One of them was:

> Organize issues and pull requests of the organizationâ€™s GitHub repository, by labeling them depending on their state.

Knowing, that PRs may take one of the following states:

- Ready to be merged â€” It has been reviewed, and no changes requested by the reviewer / Requested changes were accepted
- Changes Needed â€” If itâ€™s been reviewed, and some changes were requested by the reviewer
- Need Review â€” It hasnâ€™t been reviewed yet

â€¦and Issues may take one of the following states:

- Open â€”There are no pull request references to this issue. Itâ€™s open so its ready to claim, or someoneâ€™s just already claimed it, but didnâ€™t send a solution yet. It might also happened when someone send an issueâ€™s solution but its got closed and not merged
- In Progress â€”That someone already send a solution for the issue and its waiting for merge
- Multiple PRSâ€” There are many unique pull request for single issue and these are all open
- Closed â€” A PR referencing to the issue, got merged, so the issue itself can be closed

Iâ€™ve decided to learn a little bit of Python, and do some magic with GitHub, and Google Sheets API, by fully automatizing the documentation process.

Instead of wasting a couple of hours on manually labeling those issues, you run the script, that documents the whole repository in less than 2 minutes. For more info, you might want to visit the [project repository](https://github.com/letelete/easy-documentation).

## My lightning talk

I had a chance to give a lightning talk about my work during the contest. It's my first public talk ever. I was speaking in front of the Google staff and other participants. Recorded on Jun 16, 2019, at the Google HQ in Mountain View, California.

I guess I'm sharing that so we can laugh together about it ðŸ™ƒ

## Overall summary of the GCI 2018

As I mentioned before, itâ€™s been a great experience to participate in the Google Code-In contest. Iâ€™ve gained so much new knowledge and have had the opportunity to participate in such a great open-source community.

I would love to thank all mentors and people engaged in the contest for doing such a great job, being so active and supportive. Unfortunately, it was the last time I could take part in the contest, but Iâ€™ll participate in such similar events in the future for sure.
